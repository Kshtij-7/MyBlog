                </h4>
                <p>It’s been 20 years since the release of the film that redefined the Indian comedy genre of the twenty-first century – Priyadarshan’s Hera Pheri. This cult comedy was based on another classic, Ramji Rao Speaking, a Malayalam film released in 1989. Over these two decades, Hera Pheri’s become somewhat of a religious piece of film, the kind that Indian cinema folklore would pass on for generations to come — reminding everyone of Priyadarshan’s genre of humourism, Paresh Rawal’s sprightliness, and Akshay Kumar’s ability to suspend vanity.<br>

                    We’ve moved on to a dry comedy landscape now, where boorishness and crass humour is what everyone is subjected to. So if given a choice to watch any slapstick comedy again, I’d choose Hera Pheri, like any other dogmatic devotee of the film. Here’s why I believe this film has aged like fine wine.</p>

                <p>Guilty pleasure, perhaps...<br>
                    ...but I really love this movie! It's a pity this was released on the coattails of "Home Alone", since it's inevitably perceived as a knock-off. But the comparison is really unfair. "Home Alone" featured McCauley Culkin as annoying, precocious, and self-sufficient far beyond his years. The criminals who were his foils were reminiscent of The Three Stooges in their ineptitude. The one quality both Culkin and the criminals shared was a being mean spirited to some degree.
                    <br>
                    Baby Bink in "Baby's Day Out" is a true innocent who survives on luck while remaining adorably unaffected. His criminal foils are more reminiscent of Laurel & Hardy than The Three Stooges - cleverer and more subtle. In this case, the quality shared by Baby Bink and the criminals is innocence and an underlying decency.

The septet—composed of RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook—co-writes and co-produces much of their own output. Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work features references to literature and psychological concepts and includes an alternative universe storyline. The group has released several albums and performed on several world tours.</p>

        <img class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12" src="msd.jpeg">
        <p class="col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Mahendra Singh Dhoni (born 7 July 1981), is a former Indian international cricketer who captained the Indian national team in limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2017 and in Test cricket from 2008 to 2014. Under his captaincy, India won the inaugural 2007 ICC World Twenty20, the 2010 and 2016 Asia Cups, the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. A right-handed middle-order batsman and wicket-keeper, Dhoni is one of the highest run scorers in One Day Internationals (ODIs) with more than 10,000 runs scored and is considered an effective "finisher" in limited-overs formats. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest wicket-keeper batsmen and captains in the history of the game. He was also the first wicket-keeper to effect 100 stumpings in ODI cricket.
            <br>
            Dhoni made his ODI debut on 23 December 2004 against Bangladesh, and played his first Test a year later against Sri Lanka. He has been the recipient of many awards, including the ICC ODI Player of the Year award in 2008 and 2009 (the first player to win the award twice), the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award in 2007, the Padma Shri, India's fourth highest civilian honour, in 2009 and the Padma Bhushan, India's third highest civilian honour, in 2018. Dhoni was named as the captain of the ICC World Test XI in 2009, 2010 and 2013. He has also been selected a record 8 times in ICC World ODI XI teams, 5 times as captain. The Indian Territorial Army conferred the honorary rank of Lieutenant Colonel to Dhoni on 1 November 2011. He is the second Indian cricketer after Kapil Dev to receive this honour.

                            <p>It must be my power, the bat speed I generate and the swing of the bat...' Mahendra Singh Dhoni is as calm and unruffled a sportsman on the field as he is self-effacing off it. But 'brute strength', 'murderous form' and 'a man possessed' were some of the phrases that came to mind. When on 5 April 2005 in Visakhapatnam, he exploded onto international consciousness by becoming the first regular Indian keeper to score a one-day century. With his striking form on the day, his long locks visible beneath his helmet, red tints glinting in the sunlight, 'Mahi' Dhoni had transformed from a boy from an obscure small town to a sports legend with the aura of a rock star and yet, Dhoni was no child prodigy, no overnight success. When he made his international debut at 23, he was already mature by Indian cricket standards with five grinding years of domestic cricket behind him. How that legend came to be and grew from game to game is told here by noted sportswriter Gulu Ezekiel in his crackling but measured prose. Captain Cool is the story of M.S. Dhoni, Indian cricket's poster boy, it is also the heartwarming account of the life of a young man who won India the World Twenty20 in 2007 and the 50 over World Cup title in 2011 but can still tell his throngs of admirers, 'I am the same boy from Ranchi'.</p>

                            <p>Seven students are about to have their lives changed by one amazing teacher in this school story sequel filled with unique characters every reader can relate to.
<br>
It’s the start of a new year at Snow Hill School, and seven students find themselves thrown together in Mr. Terupt’s fifth grade class. There’s . . . Jessica, the new girl, smart and perceptive, who’s having a hard time fitting in; Alexia, a bully, your friend one second, your enemy the next; Peter, class prankster and troublemaker; Luke, the brain; Danielle, who never stands up for herself; shy Anna, whose home situation makes her an outcast; and Jeffrey, who hates school.
 <br>
They don’t have much in common, and they’ve never gotten along. Not until a certain new teacher arrives and helps them to find strength inside themselves—and in each other. But when Mr. Terupt suffers a terrible accident, will his students be able to remember the lessons he taught them? Or will their lives go back to the way they were before—before fifth grade and before Mr. Terupt?
<br>
Find out what happens in sixth and seventh grades in Mr. Terupt Falls Again and Saving Mr. Terupt. And don't miss the conclusion to the series, Goodbye, Mr. Terupt, coming soon!

                </h4>
                <p>It’s been 20 years since the release of the film that redefined the Indian comedy genre of the twenty-first century – Priyadarshan’s Hera Pheri. This cult comedy was based on another classic, Ramji Rao Speaking, a Malayalam film released in 1989. Over these two decades, Hera Pheri’s become somewhat of a religious piece of film, the kind that Indian cinema folklore would pass on for generations to come — reminding everyone of Priyadarshan’s genre of humourism, Paresh Rawal’s sprightliness, and Akshay Kumar’s ability to suspend vanity.<br>

                    We’ve moved on to a dry comedy landscape now, where boorishness and crass humour is what everyone is subjected to. So if given a choice to watch any slapstick comedy again, I’d choose Hera Pheri, like any other dogmatic devotee of the film. Here’s why I believe this film has aged like fine wine.</p>

                <p>Guilty pleasure, perhaps...<br>
                    ...but I really love this movie! It's a pity this was released on the coattails of "Home Alone", since it's inevitably perceived as a knock-off. But the comparison is really unfair. "Home Alone" featured McCauley Culkin as annoying, precocious, and self-sufficient far beyond his years. The criminals who were his foils were reminiscent of The Three Stooges in their ineptitude. The one quality both Culkin and the criminals shared was a being mean spirited to some degree.
                    <br>
                    Baby Bink in "Baby's Day Out" is a true innocent who survives on luck while remaining adorably unaffected. His criminal foils are more reminiscent of Laurel & Hardy than The Three Stooges - cleverer and more subtle. In this case, the quality shared by Baby Bink and the criminals is innocence and an underlying decency.

            <h4>This is my favourite music band</h4>
            <p>BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan), also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a seven-member South Korean boy band that began formation in 2010 and debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment. The septet—composed of RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook—co-writes and co-produces much of their own output. Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work features references to literature and psychological concepts and includes an alternative universe storyline. The group has released several albums and performed on several world tours.</p>
